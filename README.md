### How to use

Smash Ultimate is very "mashy" game, where characters can seemingly hit your shield with aerials and go unpunished.  
In order to show how this application can used to effect, an example will be walked through.

#### Example  

Roy is a very mashy character, and when he is spamming on your shield it may seem completely unpunishable especially if you are not aware of which of his moves are safe or not, so for this use case we will look at Roy vs Falco

A lot of Roys love to mash Jab, so by inputting Roy into the first dropdown and then clicking on the second box you will be shown a list of all of Roy's moves. For this case we will be selecting Jab.
